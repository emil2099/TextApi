        <p class="lead">Text classification API allows granular analysis of themes and sentiment.</p>
        <p>Our algorithm is different from your typical theme classifier in a way that allows to quickly define themes and concepts
        using a few words - no tagging and labelling required. This is is important as training data is often difficult
        to obtain and training labels don't always match the classification task in hand.</p>
        <p>In this demo the classifier has been trained to understand the language of banking. It can take customer
        feedback or complaints and classify them by customer channel, product and root cause</p>
        <p><strong>Classes covered:</strong> online, mobile, branch, telephony, staff, processes, credit card, debit card, lending, overdraft </p>
